This is project is all about analyzing the popular  titanic dataset. It was divided into four parts. Namely, the cleaning part, the analysis part, modelilng, and classification. I have not done the classification part yet. 
The titanic_cleaned.csv dataset in the this repo is the cleaned version of the titanic data. I have removed some columns from it and converted every column to numeric column. 

CLEANINING PART: This is the part where I wrangled the data. remove null values, remove not so relevant columns and finally converted the 
data into numeric form. The outcome of this is the titanic_cleaned.csv found in the repo. Anyone can pick this file and go straight into 
modeling. 

ANALYSIS: i carried out analysis of the data in this part. Trying to bring out insights. discoverying certain hidden stuff in the data. 

MODELING: i used about three different algorithms in this part. i used logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest. 

CLASSIFICATION: This is the part where i intend to classify every passenger in titanic based on certain feature.
