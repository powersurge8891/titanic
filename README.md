This is project is all about analyzing the popular  titanic dataset. It was divided into four parts. Namely, the cleaning part, the analysis part, modelilng and classification. I have not don the classification part yet. 
The titanic_cleaned.csv dataset in the this repo is the cleaned version of the titanic data. I have removed some columns from it and converted every column to numeric column.
